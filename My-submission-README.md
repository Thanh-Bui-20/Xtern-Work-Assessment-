After picking the coworking location that I find the most covinient, I proceed to researched many different locations of restaurants, attractions, and fun events throughout the area of Downtown Indianapolis. The above list of restaurants is all located near walking or driving distance to the coworking location I chose, these restaurants all have rating above 4.0 stars and more than 1000+ different reviews. All of them offered atmospheres from modest/professional to casual/friendly. I also chose different types of cuisine, ranging from American to Latin and Japanese cuisines; although majority of them more focused on American culture, there's also seafood spot that's included in the list as well.

Chosing activites also depended on the coworking location I choose, the events are also located near downtown Indianapolis area. I choose a lot of different catergories for these events, from fun group activiy like scavenging hunt or escape room, to a more sophisticated outlook like plays at theater, or orchestra event. A third of the chosen events depend on group decision, for example, visiting Indiana State Museum require the team to choose a date and time where everyone is comfortable with. Others already have a set date or set time range that we can choose from. All of these events started from May, 1 till mid July. 

I am not very familiar with the provided sofwares use to created visualization for the data set, which is the reason why I won't be able to provide the visualization of my findings. My deepest appologies for this flaw in my work assessment, I will improve on this particular skill better in future time. But in the mean time, please accept this shortcoming of mine. Thank you very much and have a great day.
